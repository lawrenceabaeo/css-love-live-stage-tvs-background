Love Live School Idol is a Japanese entertainment franchise about a fictional group of nine high school girls that perform as a group singing ‘School Idols’.\r\n\r\n##Features\r\nScalable. The font and display should be resizable while maintaining the original grid layout. \r\n\r\n##Why did I make this? \r\nI wanted an imitation backdrop to display on a real monitor (or phone, or tablet); this would be  a backdrop for anime figures in real life. It was also a test to recall/relearn css skills, and a challenge to learn more.\r\n\r\n##What tech things were needed?\r\n\r\n###Font\r\nThe font is Dotline, created by ‘Honey and Death’, and was downloaded from here: [http://www.fontspace.com/honey-and-death/dotline](http://www.fontspace.com/honey-and-death/dotline\r\n)\r\n\r\n###Skills that were learned:\r\ntext-shadow\r\ncolor opacity\r\nz-index\r\npositioning (absolute/relative/static)\r\nbasic box-model\r\nbox-sizing\r\nusing css table versus html table\r\nmaintaining aspect ratio while scaling (for the grids, used padding-width, for the fonts used viewport units)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
